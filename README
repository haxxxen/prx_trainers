Cheat prx trainers for various games. You can toggle cheats on and off with
simple msgdialog and OSK. The prx files should work fine for DEX with COBRA
or for CEX with CCAPI installed.

You could either use ingame_loader to patch eboots with these sprx files
(MANDATORY FOR USING THEM WITH CCAPI!!!), or use my EBOOTloader.sprx file,
to load from bootplugins.txt with COBRA and then load the trainer prx files
with button combo to game process.

If the trainer is successfully loaded to game process, you will get a message
dialog, naming the game and also telling the button combo to call the menu.
To call the menu, you have to press SELECT+START at any time in game.

system gui.
