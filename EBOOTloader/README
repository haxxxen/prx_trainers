EBOOTloader.sprx file, to load from bootplugins.txt with COBRA.

To load any sprx file to game process you can edit sprx.txt in dev_hdd0/tmp
to your likings.

To load the sprx file to game process, you have to go to ingame xmb and then
press R1+O. If successfully loaded, you will get popup message, saying
"PRX successfully loaded" and additionally saying path to loaded sprx file.
Otherwise you will get error popup.

Do note, that some games do not like to get loaded a sprx file this way and the
PS3 will reboot if you exit game. It doesn't harm any damage when rebooting and
you will not get the improper shutdown message. It just makes tripple beep and
reboots, just like Tomb Raider Game. THIS I cannot fix unluckily. Besides, this
works great.
